# Avidemux-unofficial-appimage
Avidemux version built from https://deb-multimedia.org (Debian Testing) to use the user's system theme configuration (eg Adwaita Dark or Breeze).

This repository contains the recipe (for pkg2appimage), the official AppRun with a modification to use any theme (not just "Fusion" which is the default theme in the original project) and the AppImage itself.

# Disclaimer
The AppImage is built for Debian Testing, so it works with recent systems that support GLIBC to the version used by Debian Testing when creating the AppImage. I created this AppImage because I didn't like the default theme and wanted to use the system theme without having to update all dependencies and packages to the version used in "deb-multimedia".

If this is not a problem for you, rely on the official AppImage (at http://avidemux.sourceforge.net), the version available in the [deb-multimedia repositories](https://deb-multimedia.org) (only for Debian) or [the one available in the repositories of your distribution](https://pkgs.org/search/?q=avidemux).

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
