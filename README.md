# Avidemux-unofficial-appimage
Avidemux version built from https://deb-multimedia.org (Debian Testing) to use the user's system theme configuration (eg Adwaita Dark or Breeze).

This repository contains the recipe (for pkg2appimage), the official AppRun with a modification to use any theme (not just "Fusion" which is the default theme in the original project) and the AppImage itself.

# Disclaimer
The AppImage is built for Debian Testing, so it works with recent systems that support GLIBC to the version used by Debian Testing when creating the AppImage. I created this AppImage because I didn't like the default theme and wanted to use the system theme without having to update all dependencies and packages to the version used in "deb-multimedia".

If this is not a problem for you, rely on the official AppImage (at http://avidemux.sourceforge.net), the version available in the [deb-multimedia repositories](https://deb-multimedia.org) (only for Debian) or [the one available in the repositories of your distribution](https://pkgs.org/search/?q=avidemux).

## Install and update it with ease

I wrote two bash scripts to install and manage the applications: [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager) and [AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan). Their dual existence is based on the needs of the end user.

| <sub>***If you want to install system-wide applications on your GNU/Linux distribution in a way that is compatible with [Linux Standard Base](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml) (all third-party apps must be installed in dedicated directories under `/opt` and their launchers and binaries in `/usr/local/*` ...), just use ["AM" Application Manager](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager). This app manager requires root privileges only to install / remove applications, the main advantage of this type of installation is that the same applications will be available to all users of the system.***</sub>

| <sub>***If you don't want to put your app manager in a specific path but want to use it portable and want to install / update / manage all your apps locally, download ["AppMan"](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan) instead. With this script you will be able to decide where to install your applications (at the expense of a greater consumption of resources if the system is used by more users). AppMan is portable, all you have to do is write the name of a folder in your `$HOME` where you can install all the applications available in [the "AM" database](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/tree/main/programs), and without root privileges.***</sub>
