# Avidemux-unofficial-appimage
Avidemux version built from https://deb-multimedia.org (Debian Testing) to use the user's system theme configuration (eg Adwaita Dark or Breeze).

This repository contains the recipe (for pkg2appimage), the official AppRun with a modification to use any theme (not just "Fusion" which is the default theme in the original project) and the AppImage itself.

# Disclaimer
The AppImage is built for Debian Testing, so it works with recent systems that support GLIBC to the version used by Debian Testing when creating the AppImage. I created this AppImage because I didn't like the default theme and wanted to use the system theme without having to update all dependencies and packages to the version used in "deb-multimedia".

If this is not a problem for you, rely on the official AppImage (at http://avidemux.sourceforge.net), the version available in the [deb-multimedia repositories](https://deb-multimedia.org) (only for Debian) or [the one available in the repositories of your distribution](https://pkgs.org/search/?q=avidemux).
